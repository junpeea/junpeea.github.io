## A spatio-temporal evaluation of emerging climate risk factors on COVID-19 outcomes in Reno and Las Vegas, Nevada.
*Background*: Climate change in Nevada has led to multiple health risks, including poor air quality, wildfire, and
excess heat stress. Recent studies have provided evidence that both short- and long-term exposure to air
pollution and extreme heat may exacerbate COVID-19 outcomes, including increased mortality risk [1-5], but
these health effects require further investigation within local communities and subpopulations for better improving
public health systems. The project aims to enhance the estimation of the health effects of major climate risk
factors, building on the PIâ€™s expertise in data analytics and advanced Bayesian hierarchical methodologies [6-11].
*Methods*:
In this study, we construct a comprehensive dataset encompassing air pollution exposures, heat waves,
wildfire smoke, COVID-19 outcomes, and various non-environmental factors with spatial and temporal
dimensions. We conduct state-of-the-art statistical analysis to estimate the health effect of the climate risk
factors on COVID-19 outcomes in Reno and Las Vegas. We will publish a vulnerability mapping website as
well as high-impact journal articles based on the analysis outputs.
*Implications*: Our findings may indicate a significant association or potential causation between long-term
exposure to climate risk factors and COVID-19 outcomes in Nevada, highlighting the need for establishing an
unified and publicly accessible research framework applicable to various Disease Mapping studies in Nevada.
