Spatial or Spatio-temporal data are gaining increasing interest in the era of the global pandemic and the Fourth Industrial Revolution. I have been broadly studying theories, methodologies, and applications that can be used to analyze such data within the disciplines of Statistics, Epidemiology, and Machine Learning. I am developing an outstanding research career in Spatial Statistics, Spatial Epidemiology, Environmental Epidemiology, and Machine Learning particularily for spatially dependent data. I want to share my knowledge and experiences about those research interests in this section.
