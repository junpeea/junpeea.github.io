Spatial or spatio-temporal data are gaining increasing interest in the era of the global pandemic and the Fourth Industrial Revolution. I have been broadly studying theories, methodologies, and application that can be used to analyze such data within the disciplines of Statistics, Epidemiology, and Machine Learning field. I am devleoping a distinctive research career in Spatial Statistics, Spatial Epidemiology, Environmental Epidemiology, and Machine Learning for spatially dependent data. I would like to share my knowledge and experiences about those research interests in this section.
