Spatial epidemiology has seen considerable advances in recent years. Not only have methodologic advances been rapid during the late 1990s and 2000s, but the permeation and diffusion of the methods in areas of human and veterinary epidemiology have also been considerable. It is now commonplace to consider a geographic dimension to be included within a research design in studies involving nutrition, physical activity, and community intervention, as well as studies of health outcomes related to environmental and social determinants [reference](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2021.1880230)

Abstract :\
The world is experiencing a pandemic due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as COVID-19. The USA is also suffering from a catastrophic death toll from COVID-19. Several studies are providing preliminary evidence that short- and long-term exposure to air pollution might increase the severity of COVID-19 outcomes, including a higher risk of death. In this study, we develop a spatiotemporal model to estimate the association between exposure to fine particulate matter PM2.5 and mortality accounting for several social and environmental factors. More specifically, we implement a Bayesian zero-inflated negative binomial regression model with random effects that vary in time and space. Our goal is to estimate the association between air pollution and mortality accounting for the spatiotemporal variability that remained unexplained by the measured confounders. We applied our model to four regions of the USA with weekly data available for each county within each region. We analyze the data separately for each region because each region shows a different disease spread pattern. We found a positive association between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and the mortality from the COVID-19 disease for all four regions with three of four being statistically significant. Data and code are available at our GitHub repository. Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear on-line.

Abstract :\
We propose a spatially clustered Disease mapping technique for a long-term individual-level cohort study to detect the effect of spatio-temporally correlated covarates as well as the cluster configuration of disease outcome of interest. We will construct a survival regression model with cluster-wise varying regression parameters, and illustrate an algorithm under Bayesian Reversible-Jump-Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (RJMCMC) framework. We will present some simulation studies and investigate the following performance: 1) cluster configuration, 2) hazard rate of interest, and 3) survival probabilities. Finally, we will evaluate the risk of ambient particulate matter (PM10) concentration on In Vetro Fertilization (IVF) which is assumed to be heterogenous across sub-regions of Seoul, Korea, 2016.
