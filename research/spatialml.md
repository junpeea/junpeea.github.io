## Random Forest Prediction Interval for Spatial data
Paper  link : (working in progress)
Github link : (working in progress)
Abstract :\
Spatial dependence of a response variable has often been ignored in constructing nonparametric prediction intervals of random forest algorithms, which results in a potential risk of either low accuracy or low efficiency in such applications. We propose a generalized version of out-of-bag guided random forest prediction interval, which is well-adapted for spatially dependent data, using dependency adjusted regression tree (DART) node-splitting and a novel nonparametric kernel out-of-bag estimator for the underlying conditional prediction error distribution. We illustrate methodological, theoretical, and empirical results, implying that our proposed prediction interval is valid, consistent, and generally more efficient under spatial dependence.
