My teaching philosophy starts with a teacher who provides high-quality courses and serves as a good mentor to students. This includes a life of giving and paying forward, something special and spatial, and communication and support in the era of global pandemic and online education environment.

## A life of giving and paying forward
Throughout my education, a large number of people have played an important role in building my career path and personality as a teacher and mentor. [Dr. Chae-Young, Lim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w8zE47kAAAAJ&hl=th), my Ph.D. advisor, showed me how to mentor graduate students. I was able to learn (1) how to explain the basic concepts for an independent researcher to students step by step, (2) how to comfort and encourage those who were despaired due to unexpected difficulties, and (3) how to guide students toward appropriate academic words and behaviors.  Next, [Dr. Seon-Young, Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=2y0LmGUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), my former collaborator, was a good example of kindness and faithfulness. For example, she expressed politeness and respect to me and other collaborators, as well as having a warm-hearted personality like a friend. Even when guiding the tough project, she made us feel that she sincerely kept her promises and did her best to provide comments and feedback. Finally, [Dr. Daniel Nettleton](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5TdAL2cAAAAJ&hl=en), one of my postdoc academic advisors, guided me to be equipped with expertise in research and education at the worldwide level. Being inspired by all the supports that I have received, I firmly believe that this allowed me to become ready to share my experience and knowledge with the next generation of students interested in the core principles, techniques, and good philosophy of Statistics.

## Special and Spatial
I can introduce myself as something special and spatial because I have specialized in teaching the following three areas: Spatial Statistics, Spatial Epidemiology, and Statistical Learning for spatial data. I am confident with teaching courses from introductory to advanced levels about those areas. In particular, I want to teach an introductory course for undergraduates in Statistics. I have been studying basic courses broadly in Mathematics and Statistics, as well as having several experiences as a research assistant. For instance, I have recently taught “Probability and Statistics for Computer Science (STAT 330)” as an instructor for an undergraduate in the department of Computer Science at Iowa State University. Next, I am excited to develop courses in Spatial Statistics using a lot of learning materials from abundant research assistant experiences. Moreover, I can provide some seminary classes targeting graduate students, including general topics in Spatial Epidemiology and Statistical Learning for spatial data. There is an apparent need for understanding statistical theories, methodologies, and applications for spatially referenced data, and my ultimate goal is to become a special spatial instructor.

## Communication and Support
I believe that teachers living in the era of industrial revolution and global pandemic should have the ability to manage both in-person and online platform for a successful educational environment and facilitate a solid communication. Throughout my teaching experience at Iowa State University this summer, I had work experience where the lectures, assignments, and exams were all online. Students were able to study pre-recorded lecture videos according to the academic calendar, study anywhere at their own pace, and were able to submit quizzes, homework, and even midterm and final exams online for evaluation. I have learned that it is necessary to familiarize myself with the online platform and make an effort to maximize the benefits of online classes. However, I realized that we should also be careful about the most important but difficult factor, communication. Looking ahead, I would not only respond and communicate through Canvas or email, but I will also make sure to provide more support for students who struggle with motivation. I wish to sincerely show concern and care for each and every student whether that is through online platform or in person.
