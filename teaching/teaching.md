My teaching philosophy starts with a teacher who provides high-quality courses and serves as a good advisor and mentor to students. This includes a life of giving and paying forward, something special and spatial, and communication and support in the era of global pandemic and online education environment.

## A life of giving and paying forward
Throughout my education, a large number of people have played an important role in building my career path and personality as a teacher and mentor. [Dr. Chae-Young, Lim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w8zE47kAAAAJ&hl=th), my Ph.D. advisor, showed me how to mentor graduate students. I was able to learn (1) how to explain the basic concepts for an independent researcher to students step by step, (2) how to comfort and encourage those who were despaired due to unexpected difficulties, and (3) how to guide students toward appropriate academic words and behaviors.  Next, [Dr. Seon-Young, Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=2y0LmGUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), my former collaborator, was a good example of kindness and faithfulness. For example, she expressed politeness and respect to me and other collaborators, as well as having a warm-hearted personality like a friend. Even when guiding the tough project, she made us feel that she sincerely kept her promises and did her best to provide comments and feedback. Finally, [Dr. Daniel Nettleton](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5TdAL2cAAAAJ&hl=en), one of my postdoc academic advisors, guided me to be equipped with expertise in research and education at the worldwide level. Being inspired by all the supports that I have received, I firmly believe that this allowed me to become ready to share my experience and knowledge with the next generation of students interested in the core principles, techniques, and good philosophy of Statistics.
