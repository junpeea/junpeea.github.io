May the Lord give us victory wherever He sends us in the future, and let all the faculty and students we meet deserve to see that I have been established as a professor. Lord, but I also want to keep in mind the cross of suffering and glory that I will carry in the future. Remembering God who follows even a single sheep that strays to the end, may we overcome any adversity and trials through the love of Christ. May the Lord be with you in the process of choosing a job and negotiating employment, so let us handle everything wisely.

Prayer: Meditate on why the Lord gave us the mission to give birth to and raise children. Let us keep in mind that even parents who have given birth to children in the flesh can go crazy and fall into tyrants who use verbal abuse and violence if they are not possessed by the Holy Spirit.

PRAYER: Lord, I see how vicious a life that forgets grace and puts out its own greed can become. Let us discover God today, who thoroughly destroys Satan's evil plans and uses it as a stepping stone to achieve good will. The Lord has finally allowed us the opportunity to develop our skills at a prestigious school, and has opened up the possibility of working at a school that seems to be relatively good for immigrant life, but hopefully a school and a city where we can serve with joy and gratitude. Please guide me to choose Amen.

Prayer: When the church was going through a lot of difficult things due to division and conflict, we thank the Lord for the grace of holding us together through the Changwon-Dayoung couple so that we would not stumble because of this. May the Lord bless this family and use them as faithful workers to build the church. I hope that God who started a good work in Ames will carry it out until the day of Christ Jesus. We pray that our church will practice loving one another, grow into a holy community, and be filled with the fruits of righteousness through Jesus.

Bless Sister Hongdan, whom the Lord loves, and use her as a faithful co-worker helping her husband in Christ and a faithful mother raising her children. Her wife has decided to start her immigrant life with me, but she is seeking, seeking, and tapping into her own vision and what her calling is. May the Lord, who has great and wonderful plans for her wife, grant us the grace that together we will achieve what you intend. Amen.

In the process of accepting the vision and calling of the Lord and preparing for a new life as an immigrant, let our couple become holy and faithful every day through the communion of the Holy Spirit. May the great thinking ability be developed through the sights that move the heartstrings, and may a great character be formed while going through great difficulties. Amen.

Prayer: Lord, what have I done and what are my sins that my wife is making it so hard on me? Not only that, but since I am an inexperienced father and raised her children, how should I handle this? Lord, please remind me that I am not the only one struggling as the head of the household, and give me more wisdom and courage every day to overcome difficulties ahead through meeting good books and good relationships. Amen.

PRAYER: Lord, the older I get, the more it seems to me that at home, at church, or at work, other people dress me up and pull me in a direction I don't want. Let me do what pleases the Lord beyond my feelings, relationships, and circumstances. Let's meditate on the way of the cross that our Lord Jesus walked. How could I, being unfaithful, dare to die and lightly swear to follow the Lord and carry my cross? Nevertheless, I beg you, do not hesitate to make any kind of dedication or sacrifice for the glory that the Lord will receive! May the rest of my life be filled with the Holy Spirit, so that my wife at home may be more happy, serve my parents and professors, raise children and disciples, and impress my neighbors. Amen.

Meditation: Saul tried to kill Jonathan with a javelin, but when Jonathan realized that his father had decided to kill David, he was very angry and left the table, and on the second day of the month he did not eat, because his father had dishonored David. It was sorrow (1Sa 20:33-34)
Prayer: Lord, the parents of both families may have considered that my husband and I have been away for a while to study abroad, but how much more will they miss or worry about us when we start immigrating to the United States in earnest in the future? It would have been nice if the family members had met Jesus personally and knew God's protection, but it's a pity how close we can become to the extent of exchanging greetings over video calls from afar. I want to pray for the salvation of my family every day. God, who is more anxiously searching for the unbelieving souls in my family than I am, please write the names of our family in the book of life with your love and kindness, and lead us to soon receive the greatest gift of all, the savior Jesus Christ, as our Savior. Please make us, who are lacking, channels for the gospel filled with the Holy Spirit, and use us as holy tools to carry out the good mission of Jesus' salvation. Amen.

PRAYER: I want to commemorate what kind of lifesaver the Lord has let me meet in the past years and saved me from a stifling puddle. How can we forget the grace of meeting Rev. Kim In-jung of Ansan Dongsan Church when I was lethargic because I couldn’t find a reason to live after completing my military service, and the grace of meeting Professor Hong Jong-in of Seoul National University and Mrs. ? I will not forget that there were many helping hands that supported our couple even during the stormy days of studying abroad in Ames. In the future, we also hope to be left as such a precious lifesaver to someone. Amen.

#11
Words: The hospitality of Ahimelech the priest (1Sa 21:1-9)
Meditation: Now, what do you have in your hand? Give five loaves of bread or whatever you have into my hand.” The priest answered David and said, “I have no ordinary bread, but I do have holy bread. If not, I will give it to you (1 Samuel 21:3-4)
PRAYER: During spring break, I have some international student friends whom I can contact by phone or meet in person. In particular, we intercede for Brother Ko Jun-seok, who is visiting our place for a short time. At first glance, it may seem like studying hard and living well, but the Lord knows how great the loneliness of studying abroad and the spiritual hunger for the Lord are. We have put aside our many duties and invited Brother Junseok to provide meals and lodging. We pray that he and other international students will enjoy peace and rest in the love of Christ. Amen.

#12
Word: desperate struggle to live (1Sa 21:10-15; Phil 1:27-30)

Prayer: Keep in mind the words of the dean of Health College who said that my success is the success of the school, and do not let me lose my inner composure out of fear that I may not live up to his expectations! I pray that you will become a believer who thinks and acts worthy of the gospel of Christ in any situation. Wherever we are, let our couple stand with one mind and unite for the gospel faith with one will, and let us not be afraid of those who oppose us in anything. Let this prayer be the evidence of your salvation, so that you not only believe in Christ, but also fully endure suffering for His sake. Amen.

Prayer: Will you be able to handle the life of an immigrant living in the United States with your wife and children, serving the entrusted students and running a laboratory as a professor? I am trying to find my way forward by studying pregnancy, tax, insurance, credit card, car, and real estate, but I find that I have no way to overcome anxiety, sadness, and helplessness without believing in the Lord who is with me. Even if difficulties deepen and hope seems dim as the days go by, let us follow the Lord's instructions to faithfully take care of, serve, and love those entrusted to us. Amen.

Meditation: David said to Abiathar, "On that day Doeg the Edomite was there, so I knew that he would surely tell Saul. It is my fault that everyone in your father's house is dead. Do not be afraid; stay with me; he who seeks my life will save your life. I am the one who seeks you, and if you are with me, you will be safe (1 Samuel 22:22-23).
Prayer: It is so painful to see the reality of the church being trampled on by unrighteous political or religious leaders. In today's phenomenon where people are being seduced and harmed by the instigation of bad politicians or the false doctrines of pseudo-religious cults, isn't it clear that I and the established churches are responsible for not shining the light of the gospel properly? I am grateful for the grace that allowed me to start a one-on-one Bible study with Brother Lim Pil-hyeon, a doctoral student at ISU, starting next week. First of all, as a faithful soldier of God, let me set an example of keeping away from evil and being close to the Word, and let me become a good gospel worker who encourages my brothers and sisters around me that it is safe to be with Jesus. Amen.

#15

Prayer: Lord, is it really right to try to contribute somehow to the thesis research work in order to fulfill your responsibility as a researcher, even while traveling in Chicago with friends during spring break?

Prayer: ISU is supposed to do an Annual Postdoc Review, and on the other hand, I think it's a great opportunity to accuse Professor Yanzhu Jiang of his wrongdoings. We hear the warnings of our conscience that the Lord will not be pleased with us. Doesn't the Lord know that Professor Zeng Yanzhu was especially often late this year, was sometimes absent without prior notice, and did not give enough time for my thesis review even though I asked for it? The Lord will judge between me and the advisor, and the Lord will repay you for your righteousness, but I will not harm the professor with my mouth. So the Lord will be the judge and examine my circumstances and set me free and free me from the hands of the evil spirit. I beg you to deliver me from this. Amen.

Let us praise the immeasurable grace of our Lord Jesus who has made all things work together for good. Amen.

#19
Words: When pride is hurt (1Sa 25:1-13; Phil 1:12-26)
Meditation: Ask your boys, and they will tell you. Therefore, let my boys find favor with you. We have come on a good day; we want to give to your servants and to your son David what is in your hand.” (1 Samuel 25:8)
Prayer: Lord, as the breadwinner of the family and a professor who will run a laboratory at a public university in the future, I hope that there will never be a case where I have to put up with criticism and ridicule without proper examples even after working hard. Even if I do, may the Holy Spirit hold my thoughts and heart so that I don't aggravate the problem by expressing my anger because of pride. Even if I am unfair and upset while carrying out the mission entrusted to me by the Lord, I hope that I will somehow contribute to the spread of the gospel of Jesus and give thanks. Amen.

She said that she would go, but did not inform her husband, Nabal (1 Samuel 25:18-19).
Prayer: Relatives and church members are dedicated to taking care of my father-in-law in Yanji, China, and I am afraid that my father-in-law will look down on them with a bad attitude. Although my husband and I are preparing not only emotional support for our father-in-law, but also financial support, we confess that there is no one to rely on except Jesus to solve the fundamental problem. In this regard, I hope that the hardships and burdens will no longer be added to our couple, but please do not do as we wish, but guide our family according to your will. Amen.

#21
Word: Valuable advice (1Sa 25:23-35)
Meditation: David said to Abigail, "Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, who sent you today to receive me. And your wisdom will be praised, and may you be blessed. Today you have prevented me from shedding blood and taking vengeance yourself." 25:32-33)
PRAYER: How fortunate I was to be able to forbid my foolish words and actions thanks to my wise wife who respects me, sympathizes with me, and suggests a wise alternative when I am flustered by the delay in my appointment as a professor at the University of Reno. Is it! Let her work well with her wife to review the contract, and guide her to discuss and decide on the essentials for her future immigration life. Amen.

#22
Word: God who presides over meeting and parting (1Sa 25:36-44)
Meditation: Abigail hurriedly got up, rode on a donkey, and went with David's messengers with five virgins following him, and she became David's wife. David also married Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both became his wives. David's wife, Michal, was given to Paldi son of Laish, who lived in Gallim (1 Samuel 25:42-44).
Prayer: On the other hand, there are people who leave the church due to personal circumstances or disappointment in the church. I pray that the Lord will allow our families and churches to meet people who are suitable for the duties assigned to them and keep away from people who are inappropriate. Amen.

#23
Message: The kind of leader the Lord expects (1Sa 26:1-12)
Meditation: The Lord forbids me to stretch out my hand against the Lord's anointed, so let's go with only the spear by his head and the jug of water (1 Sam 26:11)
Prayer: Isn't the figure of a scholar expected by the Lord not to betray faith and act self-centeredly when given a chance, but to break through the crisis of the community with strong faith and determination in any harsh environment? Now that I have achieved my goal of being appointed as a professor, I pray that you overcome the temptation to neglect your current job, and that you faithfully fulfill your promise to be faithful to the work entrusted to the end in front of our Lord even if you do not see results well. Amen.

#24
The Word: How to make amends? (1 Samuel 26:13-25)
Meditation: Now, my lord the king, listen to your servant. You said, "Go and serve other gods," and today you have cast me out and keep me from participating in the inheritance of the Lord (1 Samuel 26:19).
Prayer: How can I be praised for wasting a lot of time with arrogance and greed while claiming to be a steward serving the Lord? How can I not blame myself for there are still many times when I wield a sword at my family and professors, whom I have to serve as the next-generation leader? ? However, I will not resent or complain against you because of my foolishness. Please save me from all tribulation. Let people know that the Lord has blessed me and my family, and let them believe that because the Lord has done great things, they will surely be victorious. Amen.

#25
Word: Uncomfortable cohabitation with the enemy (1Sa 27:1-28:2)
Meditation: David thought in his heart that in the latter days I would fall into the hands of Saul, and it would be better for me to escape into the land of the Philistines. 1 Samuel 27:1)
Prayer: I reflect on the fact that there were many cases where I acted thinking that it would be better to avoid reality and enjoy entertainment because of the fear and sense of futility that I might not be able to achieve meaningful results at my current job even if I continue to cling. If you are addicted to YouTube or other entertainment media, it seems that you temporarily forget the suffering of reality, but it is not easy to get out of it, even though you know the danger of being entangled in Satan's deeper snare. Lord, since we and our children have been called to be the light and salt of the gospel in this age, we cannot live completely disconnected from digital civilization. Please do not provide.

Prayer: During a one-on-one Bible study session with Brother Pilhyun, we had time to study together on the topic "What is sin?" We are all sinners in a state of disobedience against God, and after leaving God, we will see all kinds of evil acts that violate God's will and commandments as evidence of sin because of our totally fallen nature and its influence. Let us not remain in the state of spiritual death where we waste our lives on imperfect idols because we cannot endure the suffering of not hearing God's voice, and we will be born again through the blood of Jesus and restore our heart to yearn for Heavenly Father, and receive the fruit of eternal life under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.

beautiful baton touch
(Looking back at the couples Bible study group)

Last winter, on a day when my body and mind were frozen due to the severe snowstorm that hit Ames and the cold wave at work, I was very happy to hear that the pastor was planning to start a Bible study meeting. I would like to briefly introduce to you what kind of grace we have received through the last six bible study meetings, and what kind of changes have occurred as a result of that grace.

First, I had the grace to look back on how I believed in Jesus. I had time to analyze and organize what kind of God I believe in, what were the symptoms of sin that Ames faced during his study abroad life, and how Jesus Christ could be the perfect solution to this. Next, there was grace to observe how other saints are meeting Jesus. Listening to my wife's questions and sharing was impressive, and listening to the pastor's commentary and answers was beneficial to better understand the core principles of the gospel. On the other hand, I was challenged on how to preach Jesus to unbelievers around me. Even if my husband and I learn about the gospel by reading the Bible or participating in Bible study at church, our family members, friends, and office workers feel the burden of how they can come in contact with the gospel. There is a saying that the bible of non-believers is the life of a Christian, and I thought that starting from me, I would have more opportunities to meet Jesus if I got to know Jesus and imitate him. I also organized what words to answer if they asked a question about a topic covered in the Bible study.

Then, what would be the result of the grace received through this bible study? First, on a personal level, I developed inner strength to overcome various crises in life. Whenever fear, loneliness, or emptiness due to family problems, problems in church life, problems in work life or career, etc., blows like a storm, I am in the great and amazing providence of Almighty God, and I hope that all our sins will be completely forgiven. I was able to endure enough while remembering that I am receiving the love of Christ as great as I am. Second, the heart of love toward the Rock Church has been added. Although it was a short period of time, I wonder if I fell in love with the pastor, and I also wanted to keep in touch with the pastor and continue fellowship. Third, we provided an opportunity to restore the embers of evangelism that were dying out. At the end of the Bible study, the pastor encouraged me to teach someone what I had learned in the future. He looked for people around him who wanted to know God, and he personally invited them to study the Bible together. As a result, Brother Lim Pil-hyun and I are now enjoying the blessing of having one-on-one Bible study together. Wherever you are and whatever you do, please pray that you will live as a channel of blessing like Abraham.

In Ames, we can hear the chirping of birds and the warm sunshine of spring has arrived and is melting our bodies and minds. We give glory and praise to our Lord God the Father who allowed us to continue the baton touch of beautiful faith, hope and love through Ames Rock Church!
#29
Word: How does salvation come? (1 Samuel 30:1-20)
Meditation: The people were saddened by their children, so let's stone David. David was in great urgency, but he took courage in the Lord his God. When he brought it to David, David inquired of the LORD, and he said, "If I pursue this army, will they overtake me?" The LORD answered him, "Follow him, and you will surely catch up and find him back." (1 Samuel 30:6-8)
Prayer: Lord, after barely escaping from the crisis of finding a job, I find my weakness in my urgency in the face of the crisis of my thesis performance. Lord, I just revised/supplemented ISU's first statistical methodology thesis and asked the professor to review it. Will I be able to handle the application paper proposed by Professor Joo, the software paper proposed by Mr. Day, and the thesis review entrusted to Professor Lim? If so, let us be encouraged by the Lord our God and advance toward the promised land without hesitation. Please don't harbor a rebellious heart, asking how my current workplace's seminar participation will help my current situation, and turn my small obedience into a great help so that I can experience salvation and victory as God promised. Amen.

#30
Word: Leader's influence for good (1Sa 30:21-31)
Meditation: David said, "My brothers, since the LORD has protected us and delivered into our hands the army that came against us, you will not be able to do what he has given us. Who will listen to what you say? Just as there is a share for those who go down to the battlefield, so those who remain to keep their possessions have a share, so it is to be distributed equally to all. 23-25)
Prayer: Thank you for giving me the qualification to present a thesis at the Colorado academic conference this summer following the success of my child pregnancy and professor appointment . Since the Lord has given these inheritances into our hands to protect us, we should share the rewards equally with all our relatives, church members, workmates, and officials, not just those who fought alongside me. May we regard this practice of sharing as the ordinances and laws of our family. I intercede that our first child, who will be born in the future, will be raised as a leader who will have a good influence in Christ. Amen.

PRAYER: If the people fall on their knees and die without giving birth to mourning, but the government and leaders of all walks of life are blinded by greed and lose their balance, what hope is there for our country? Despite the grace given to the Korean people, who had suffered from Japanese colonial rule and fratricide, to enter the ranks of developed countries by receiving the mission of evangelizing Asia, they sinned against Jehovah and did not keep the word of Jehovah, did not ask, and did not repent. I am very afraid that I will be judged and destroyed. Lord, will you really forsake this country? As a citizen of the Republic of Korea, let us mourn and pray for the country. Amen.

Word: Let's prevent the deterioration of the church with the Gospel (Jude 1:1-16)

Prayer: Pray for the youth ministry of Ames Banseok Church. This semester, several deacons volunteered to provide lectures and meals to young international students on five themes: addiction, marriage, money, vision, and human relationships. Among the people of the Exodus, unbelievers were destroyed, those who apostatized among the angels were judged, and even the surrounding villages affected by Sodom and Gomorrah were punished. We must never forget that we can deviate from the way of faith at any time. Let us who have been established as teachers first repent of ourselves and renew our minds and hearts through the Gospel. May a small group community be built where young people can learn the word of truth and have intimate fellowship, and let them naturally create a wave of evangelism that will inspire their friends with the gospel. May our young people armed with the Gospel transform their schools and workplaces and grow into reliable leaders who realize social justice. Amen.

Prayer: Even if the devil's fierce attack to divide husbands and wives, parents and children is predicted in the future, my family and I will build ourselves up on the most holy faith, pray with the Holy Spirit, protect ourselves with God's love, Let us wait for the mercy of Jesus to reach eternal life! If any of us do evil, please do not repay us with evil, but deliver us with good. All glory be to the Lord our Savior, the only King who will make us whole. Amen.
